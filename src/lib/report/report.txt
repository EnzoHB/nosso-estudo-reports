Similar to how a HTML would work in the sense that events bubble up, but block internal operations such as adding a child or moving it up in a array also triggers events. This will allow for example, a observer to respond to any changes in a nested child so we can change properties like last updated by for individual nodes that propagate up to the document. However, I still haven't solved the problem of fine grained permissions for individual blocks, which I think will be feasible once the data structure is implemented.",0,0

It kinda looks like an interface so I wonder if it would be less painful to just learn typescript or jsdoc once and for all. Nonethless, everything seems to be working just fine. Now, the only caveat is the separtion of concerns of the functions that is really mind bogling me. Also, took a look in the Proxy API documentation, I wasn't aware it existed",0,breakpoint

It is so damn annoying getting it to work, but at last nonetheless I think I found out what was making it work unexpectedly. Basically, I was trying to hand down state instead of returning it and assigning in the variable (in a recursion to even make me look more fool). However, I didn't not figure it out yet and dispite having worked for about 30 hours only in this function, it is far from being either optimazed nor maintainable long term. The next step will be to refactor each and every single one of its components into folders as I understimated how a pain in the ass would a thousand lines file be.

Got some laughs with Newton and Einstein. Unfortunately, I tried buying the domain today, but, as a minor, I cannot. Fine, I will just wait a full month before even creating a git repository.

So, I researched a lot about input styling and in the mid time, this reasearch elucidated some aspects that made the UI look clunky and figured it was the lack of room to breath. Then, I created another page, took some inspiration from some crypto websites and got to work. Now, I am a little bit happier with the result, though it means I will have to redesign everything I did yesterday. However, as it became more consistent - because now I am using something called a design system - I reckon it will be faster and won't take so long, judging half a period later I did twice as much work than yesterday.

11/24/2024,Schema,Code,15h40,19h20,"Holy shit, I didn't even know you could acess the constructor from any arbirtary thing. I was reading about Remote Code Execution, as users will be able to create their own documents and the properties they send will have to be validated before acessed, when I saw a snippet from eslint node security that showed me something really weird. At first, I thought it was something from previous implementations, but, as it turns out, it is so insecure that my own eslint doesn't even show it and, therefore, I had no ideia it even existed. Thats why this means that everything has to be structured and strongly typed as I said in earlier comments. But regarding the schema, I am actually unsure if the use of proxies would be advisible, although they essentialy obly me to use another object and not a constructor, undermining my backend developer qualitiy of life and taking a toll on readability. However, I can similate the proxies by using Object.seal() and defining the getters and setters I want to be used. I think this will allow for more flexibility and a long term intuitive approach. When someone comes to develop with me, they will be used to the inheritance syntax and won't acutally worry about the schema implementation. ",0,0
11/25/2024,Schema,Code,5h20,9h30,"Well, after some ground breaking exploration regarding proxies I settled for them and to be honest it was the best decision I have ever made. They are so flexible to work with and not only provide a true proximity with the native methods, but they also allow seamlessly error handling right out of the box without any modification of the logic. This has literally just expaanded the boundaries of what I thought I had known previously regarding these methods. However, one of the problems I still have is that I had to compromise modifiers, though in my honest opinion they were not a good ideia anyways. So, that said, the not extensibility of the array is going to be delegated to an abstraction that will sit on top of the schema class",0,0

It is working wonders and one of the main things that literally made me smile non-stop is that what I had been designing is so good, that errors that otherwise would have been a pain in the ass to find, now literally just pop up in a very descriptive manner. Comparing to what I had just a few days ago, where I couldn't have access to the call stack because everything was thrown and caught without regard for the line where it happened, I really almost cried of seeing everything working beautifully. Now, I have to code a few dozen tests for class to ensure I will not break it, and, afterwards, I will be able to create the Block abstraction for the editor. To be honest, I am so tired that I didn't even test each edge case. So I am saying it is working, though I am not so sure because I just closed vs code and will only think about it again in 2 days.",0,0
