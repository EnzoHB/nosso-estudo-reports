At first, I thought it was something from previous implementations, but, as it turns out, it is so insecure that my own eslint doesn't even show it and, therefore, I had no ideia it even existed. Thats why this means that everything has to be structured and strongly typed as I said in earlier comments. But regarding the schema, I am actually unsure if the use of proxies would be advisible, although they essentialy obly me to use another object and not a constructor, undermining my backend developer qualitiy of life and taking a toll on readability. However, I can similate the proxies by using Object.seal() and defining the getters and setters I want to be used. I think this will allow for more flexibility and a long term intuitive approach.

So I took this early morning hours to dig deep into it and it turns out the documentation is kinda wrong. Basically, whenever prometheus was trying to access its metrics from inside the container, it was being able to. However, whenever it tried to access docker's metrics from the host ip address, docker was in fact exposing its metrics on localhost, not in the ip address it was supposed too. This is because the documentation was telling us to do so. That's why the stack overflow questions which suggested sending the metrics through the docker IP directly worked, because when --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway added and entity in /etc/hosts file, it was corrrectly mapping to the enpoint docker daemon had created from the daemon.json.

I was thinking about why does this interface doesn't look pleasing to the eye and I might have found my answer. After extensively researching dashboards, I noticed the following pattern: Every single one of them has metrics which stay within the same container everytime. I literally spent an hour trying to find one that didn't and shot myself in the foot. Therefore, one of the reasons this interface might not look like great is because I have to flicker my eyes through the screen to see the metrics I wanted. As a simple test, I moved all the metrics to one side of the screen and both shockingly and suddendly it looked 10% better. Still, there is something that is missing. I think one of the reasons might be also because the header in the middle of the screen is taking up so much real state that could be used more efficiently. I will have to completely redesign that interface. Thank god I have something to build upon.",0,0
